      <p>
        <strong>Controller / Data Controller (Veri Sorumlusu):</strong> <strong>CATE</strong> (“CATE”, “we”, “us”). <br/>

        <li><strong>Other users:</strong> information provided in reports, blocks, and communications that reference you.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> security, integrity, ads, and analytics vendors may provide risk signals or aggregated measurement (typically non-identifying or pseudonymous where feasible).</li>
        <li><strong>App stores:</strong> limited subscription/purchase status and transaction metadata (we do not receive full payment card details from app stores).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="use">4) How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use personal data to operate, secure, and improve CATE, including to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide the Service:</strong> create and manage accounts, enable profiles, matching, chat, and core features.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalize discovery:</strong> recommend profiles and content based on preferences, compatibility signals, and activity patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Messaging delivery:</strong> deliver messages, compute unread counts, generate inbox summaries, and send push notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety & integrity:</strong> detect and prevent spam, fraud, impersonation, and abusive behavior; enforce our Terms; respond to reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer support:</strong> respond to inquiries, troubleshoot issues, and resolve disputes.</li>

        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> comply with lawful requests and obligations; protect rights, safety, and property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="legal">5) Legal bases / lawful grounds</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Depending on your location and applicable law, we process personal data based on one or more lawful grounds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract / necessity to provide the Service:</strong> to operate your account, provide matching and chat, and deliver features you request.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to secure the Service, prevent abuse, improve features, measure performance, and manage operations (balanced with your rights).</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (e.g., certain personalized advertising, some analytics/SDK permissions, and location permissions based on OS and local law).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> to comply with applicable laws and lawful requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Vital interests:</strong> where necessary to protect someone’s life or physical safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="sharing">6) How we share information</h2>
      <h3>6.1 With other users</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your profile information (including photos and bio) is shown to other users according to the feature design and your settings.</li>
        <li>Messages and content are shared with the recipients you choose.</li>
        <li>Some information (e.g., distance range) may be displayed approximately rather than precisely, depending on settings and feature rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 With processors / service providers</h3>
      <p>
        We use vendors to help operate CATE. They process personal data on our instructions and under contractual safeguards.
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (typical components may include Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Cloud Messaging/push notifications, and related monitoring tools).</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> for ads serving and measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics / crash reporting</strong> providers (where enabled) to understand performance and fix bugs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        We do not authorize vendors to use your personal data for their own independent purposes except where they act as separate controllers
        (for example, some advertising services may process certain data under their own terms in addition to ours).
      </p>

      <h3>6.3 For legal and safety reasons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To comply with law, regulation, court orders, or lawful government requests.</li>
        <li>To investigate, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
        <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of users, the public, or CATE.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.4 Business transfers</h3>
      <p>
        If CATE is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction,
        subject to applicable law and appropriate safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ads">7) Advertising (AdMob), analytics, and tracking</h2>
      <p>
        CATE uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads and measure ad performance. Ad technologies may use device identifiers and similar technologies
        to (a) show ads, (b) measure effectiveness, (c) limit frequency, and (d) detect fraud.
      </p>

      <h3>7.1 Data AdMob may process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising identifiers</strong> (e.g., Google Advertising ID) where permitted by your device settings and local law.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and app info</strong> (device type, OS, app version, language/region).</li>
        <li><strong>Ad interaction data</strong> (impressions, clicks, diagnostics related to ad serving).</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (country/region-level) may be inferred by network signals for compliance and measurement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.2 Personalized vs. non-personalized ads</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on your region and consent settings, ads may be:
        <strong>(i) personalized</strong> (based on identifiers and interests), or <strong>(ii) non-personalized</strong> (contextual / limited targeting).
        Where required, we will request your consent before enabling personalized advertising.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Your ad & tracking choices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device controls:</strong> you can reset or limit ad personalization in your Android/iOS settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent controls:</strong> where we provide an in-app consent/choices screen, you can update your choices at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> some platforms provide signals; we handle them as required by applicable law and platform rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.4 Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        We may use analytics to understand usage, improve features, and debug issues. Analytics may involve pseudonymous identifiers and aggregated reporting.
        You may have choices via consent prompts and device settings depending on region.
      </p>

      <h2 id="messaging">8) Messaging, content processing, and encryption</h2>
      <p>
        CATE provides chat and messaging features. <strong>CATE does not offer end-to-end encryption for messages.</strong>
        Messages are transmitted from the client and stored on our backend to enable delivery, moderation, safety features, and notifications.
      </p>

      <h3>8.1 How messaging works in CATE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> messages are stored as documents in a database (e.g., Firestore) associated with user accounts and conversations.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> server logic (e.g., Cloud Functions) may process message metadata/content to support features like push notifications,
          unread counts, and inbox summaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Mirroring:</strong> message events may be mirrored into each user’s inbox summary to enable server-side delivery logic such as
          unread counters and push notifications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.2 Content access</h3>
      <p>
        We may access, review, or use automated tools to analyze messages/content in limited circumstances, including:
        (a) to investigate reports and enforce Terms,
        (b) to comply with legal obligations,
        (c) to prevent spam/fraud/abuse,
        and (d) to ensure technical delivery and feature functionality.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Please avoid sharing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, financial account details) in chat.
        Other users can copy, screenshot, or save content you share.
      </p>

      <h2 id="location">9) Location</h2>
      <p>
        If you allow location access, we may process approximate or precise location to provide distance-based discovery and improve integrity/safety checks.
        You can disable location permissions at any time in your device settings. Some features may be limited without location.
      </p>

      <h2 id="sensitive">10) Sensitive information</h2>
      <p>
        Dating and relationship services may involve personal data that can be considered sensitive in certain jurisdictions
        (e.g., sexual orientation, relationship preferences, or content of private messages).
        We process such data only as needed to provide the Service, protect users, and comply with law.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You control what you share:</strong> do not include highly sensitive personal details in public profile fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent where required:</strong> in some regions we may rely on explicit consent for certain sensitive processing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="moderation">11) Safety, integrity, and moderation</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to user safety. We may use a combination of automated tools and human review to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detect and prevent spam, scams, fraud, and abusive behavior.</li>
        <li>Enforce our Terms, including bans/suspensions and content removal.</li>
        <li>Respond to user reports and appeals.</li>
        <li>Maintain audit logs related to safety actions and account integrity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Safety logs and enforcement records may be retained even after account deletion where necessary to prevent repeat abuse, comply with law, or resolve disputes.
      </p>

      <h2 id="retention">12) Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business and legal purposes
        (security, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, compliance).
      </p>

      <h3>12.1 Typical retention approach (high-level)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account & profile:</strong> retained while your account is active. Updated when you edit your profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages:</strong> retained while your account is active and as needed to provide chat features and safety.
          If you delete content or your account, we delete or anonymize messages where feasible, subject to backup cycles and exceptions below.</li>
        <li><strong>Reports & safety logs:</strong> may be retained longer to protect users, enforce Terms, and meet legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> data may remain in backups for a limited period before being overwritten/deleted under routine operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12.2 Deletion requests</h3>
      <p>
        You can request deletion of your account and associated data by emailing:
        <a href="mailto:cate@cate-app.com">cate@cate-app.com</a>.
        We may request verification to confirm account ownership.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rights">13) Your rights and choices</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> obtain a copy of personal data we process about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> correct inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request deletion of your account and personal data (subject to legal exceptions).</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> receive certain data in a portable format where required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Restriction / objection:</strong> object to or restrict certain processing in some circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> where processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        We may deny or limit requests where permitted by law (e.g., to protect others, comply with legal obligations, or maintain security).
      </p>

      <h2 id="intl">14) International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        CATE may use global service providers. This means your data may be processed or stored in countries other than your country of residence.
        When we transfer personal data internationally, we use safeguards required by applicable law (e.g., contractual protections, and other lawful mechanisms).
      </p>

      <h2 id="security">15) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect your data (e.g., access controls, encryption in transit, monitoring).
        However, no system is perfectly secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 id="children">16) Children</h2>
      <p>
        CATE is intended for adults. You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> (or older if required by your jurisdiction) to use the Service.
        We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact
        <a href="mailto:cate@cate-app.com">cate@cate-app.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="changes">17) Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice through the Service or by other appropriate means.
        The “Last updated” date indicates the most recent revision.
      </p>
